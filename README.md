<h1>Checklist Creator</h1>
<p>A little project I made to practice laravel</p>
<p>Use the form on the main page to make a new checklist then click on it's name to access it</p>
<p>You can add items to the checklist with the form there and when all of the the boxes are checked, the picture of me in the car will drive away</p>
